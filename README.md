 Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and content. This involves loading the data, checking for missing values, identifying outliers, and ensuring data types are appropriate.

➡️Objective: Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and content. This involves loading the data, checking for missing values, identifying outliers, and ensuring data types are appropriate.

➡️Key Steps:
-Load the dataset using pd.read_csv() or a similar function.
-Use df.info() and df. describe() to get a summary of the data.
-Check for null values: df.isnull().sum().
-Remove or fill missing values using df.fillna() or df.dropna().
-Check for duplicates with df. duplicated().

➡️Data Visualization
Objective: Visualize the data to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between features. This helps in identifying patterns or correlations

➡️Tools and Libraries:
-Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
-Pandas: These are used to handle and process data efficiently.
-Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development.
